## Introduction and purpose

This guide allows tracking of individual laboratories proposed for the subject.

Each _laboratory_ is contained in its own folder with instructions, examples and exercises in some cases.

At the end of the laboratories the student will have a thorough understanding of JEE technologies and tools needed to build complex architectures in this environment.

> WARNING: The contents of these laboratories and guides does not replace in any way the theory, means a complement for the theoretical part.
